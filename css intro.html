<h1>What is menstruation?</h1>

    Menstruation is the technical term for getting your period. About once a month,<br>
     females who have gone through puberty will experience menstrual bleeding.<br> 
     This happens because the lining of the uterus has prepared itself for a possible pregnancy<br>
      by becoming thicker and richer in blood vessels. If pregnancy does not occur, <br>
      this thickened lining is shed, accompanied by bleeding. Bleeding usually lasts for 3-8 days.<br>
       For most women, menstruation happens in a fairly regular, predictable pattern.<br> 
       The length of time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period normally<br>
        ranges from 21-35 days.<br>
